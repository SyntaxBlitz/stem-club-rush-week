STEM club rush week
===================

This is a water game I built to promote the STEM club during my high school's rush week.

The server directory houses everything you need on the server. It's written entirely in node.js, and it requires express and socket.io.

The rpi directory contains the ruby code needed to get the raspberry pi to work. It's written in ruby only because that was the most convenient language to use at the time; I was having trouble getting the appropriate node or python modules to compile, and I was coming up on a deadline. But ruby is pretty, so all is well.
